# NVG50

I was gifted this scope and found the IP camera side of it very interesting but alarmingly open. This writeup covers my efforts to know more about how it works and perhaps improve it some for my own use. While the product packaging is all NVG30, the firmware bootscreen says NVG50. :shrug: Upon further inspection, they seem to be very similar in the software stack, but distinct products. I have the NVG50 and I'm pretty pleased about that. ðŸ˜…

# Endpoints
This is equipped with a USB interface and a self-hosted WiFi endpoint.

## USB
This is pretty boring:
```
[ 6001.204655] usb 3-2: new high-speed USB device number 5 using xhci_hcd
[ 6001.341299] usb 3-2: New USB device found, idVendor=0603, idProduct=8611, bcdDevice= 1.00
[ 6001.341303] usb 3-2: New USB device strings: Mfr=1, Product=2, SerialNumber=3
[ 6001.341311] usb 3-2: Product: DEMO1
[ 6001.341313] usb 3-2: Manufacturer: NOVATEK
[ 6001.341315] usb 3-2: SerialNumber: 96680-00000-001
[ 6001.352710] usb-storage 3-2:1.0: USB Mass Storage device detected
[ 6001.352856] scsi host0: usb-storage 3-2:1.0
```

the exposed device is the sd card. No other USB endpoints are exposed.

## WiFi
This is where things get juicy. The system uses a hard-coded password of `12345678` with a static SSID. 
I found these services:
```

```

Cool, cheap wifi cam with http, rtsp, and dec-notes (which I was unfamiliar with until this, but is apparently a second conferencing solution... :shrug:)

### http
This is a simple webpage to manage the contents of the SD card. It lets the user upload new files to the various folders and download what is there. A curious "Upload Custom" form is present which plays by different rules somehow and passes the url param `?custom=1` and the files don't seem to appear on the SD card anywhere, suggesting they may end up somewhere on the device root fs. 

#### Dir Traversal
The first thing I wanted to do was escape the http root, no dice on trivial inputs from the Webpage. Still need to try it out from curl or python

#### Clobber the Index
While it kinda looks like we can upload to the http root at first glance, there is strange behavior. Uploading anything like `index.html` in the standard upload box causes the session to be closed by the host, but uploading with the `upload custom` dialog takes the file and it never shows up (as normal for that form).

#### Codec Abuse
video codecs are complicated and easy to mess up. I suspect I can upload a speciallyc rafted video file to trigger a crash on the playback feature of the scope. Default format is MP4

### rtsp
easy wins here, just popped a stream up with `ffplay rtsp://192.168.1.254:554`, easily saved it with `ffmpeg -i rtsp://192.168.1.254:554 -r 15 output.mp4`

This doesn't really take input, so it's likely not a good way to get more capabilities, but the simplicity of the output it generates makes it easy for improving the local workflow. 

### Port 3333
@TODO look into this protocol, try connecting, see if it's a good foothold
While this is port 3333, it seems unlikely that it is actually dec-notes now that I have reviewed the hostory of the protocol. 
Testing it doesn't seem to be another web interface or RTSP endpoint. I can connect via netcat, but there is no banner and I have not found a valid control sequence for it. More may be found later if I get around to that. 

### Playback Menu Option
This is an option in the menu to play videos back on the screen. 

#### Playback of other Formats
I downloaded some of the MP4 files I generated, converted them to mkv and mpeg files, and uploaded them to the web interface. Both files reported a parsing error by the web interface, so I downloaded the files again to make sure the content was correct and they seem to have uploaded fine. 

Upon entering the playback menu, the files were not present. 

Just to to satiate my curiosity, I only changed the name of the downloaded file to test_raw.MP4 and uploaded it. It did appear in the playback menu and run fine. 

#### Crafting malicious MP4 files
This seems like the most directly accessible and rich playground on the platform. We can already easily depliver a payload via USB or the webui and we can detonate with the 3 buttons on the side of the device. Not the most flexible in the wild, but a wonderfully accessible and bloaty interface for getting an initial foothold. 

### Attacking the WebUI
A few attacks here might still be valid:

#### Dir Traversal
@TODO

#### What IS the param `?custom=1`?
@TODO

### Photonic attacks
The system has a number of software features which cause behavior changes based on photon exposure. These might be leveraged in attacks

#### Blind the Auto-IR Mode
@TODO
By default, the device is in a mode which automatically changes the IR settings based on the type of lighting you encounter. I observed some delay in the changes just from normally available lights and suspect it would be trivial to make this feature highly disruptive to the system with the correct light frequencies strobed at the proper rhythm. 

#### Encoder Lag attacks
Identifying the most expensive series of photons for the system to encode could lead to scope-lag attacks.
